description: "Our beautiful custom built home is close to Traverse City, yet nestled alongside the Pelizzari Natural Area on a quiet wooded cul de sac on Old Mission Peninsula. The peaceful setting allows the residents to regain their sense of independence by enjoying the lush grounds and walkways which are fenced and secured."
