## How To Choose A Memory Care Facility

Deciding which memory care facility for your loved one may feel daunting.  After researching, you may find that facilities vary greatly and you may find yourself unsure of how to choose a memory care facility.  It is recommended that at this point, you assess your loved one's needs and priorities.  Different facilities offer varying care services.  For example, does your loved one struggle with activities related to daily living?  Does your loved one have diabetes or another chronic condition?  

At this point it may be helpful to start asking yourself a few simple questions: 

- Does my loved one show aggression or other difficult behaviors? 
- Does my family member wander or get lost? 
- Is mobility a concern?
- Does my loved one have any other chronic conditions that need to be managed? 
- Does my family member need help using the bathroom or require around the clock supervision?
- Does my family member have a need for ongoing medical treatments?


These are just a few questions to ask yourself first before determining which type of memory care facility is best for your family member.  Facilities will vary in terms of what type of accommodations they offer, meal times and quality of nutrition, fitness, and enrichment activities.  

## Are Staff Members Trained To Care For People With Dementia

Dementia is a complicated disorder that requires specialized care.  Ensure that the memory care facility is up to the most recent standards and gets annual inspections and audits to ensure they are giving proper care to their residents.  It is a good idea to ask questions about how the staff handles difficult dementia behaviors such as anger, refusing care, and withdrawal.  Finding out how they respond to these situations can help you determine the quality of care a memorycare facility can offer.  

A few ways you can assess the staff are by asking questions about training, the techniques they use to de-escalate difficult situations, and the amount of time each staff member is assigned to the residents.  It is also important to find out how staff members care for residents that are physically aggressive or those who a prone to disruptive behaviors.  

## Touring A Memory Care Facility 

When you are touring a potential memory care facility make sure the building and grounds are secured.  Are they up to date on emergency alert systems, and other safety measures?  Is there a nurse on duty at all times?  Will residents be able to seek medical help if necessary?  In addition, it can be beneficial for residents to have automatic lights, low grab bars or handrails, and emergency call lights.

## What Is The Memory Care Plan?  

Dementia is a broad disease that presents itself differently depending on the person affected.  It is important for a memory care facility to be able to create a personalized care plan for your family member.  You will want to ask about how these care plans are developed, who is involved in developing care plans, and how often they are evaluated.  Some facilities group residents by cognitive levels.  Arbor House is a small care facility that serves 6 - 8 residents at a time.
