Alzheimer's disease is a progressive form of dementia which is a broader term for conditions that negatively impact memory, thinking, and behavior.  According to the [Alzheimer's Association](https://www.alz.org), Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia and makes up 60-80% of dementia cases.  Arbor House Assisted Living specializes in caring for those who are experiencing memory loss and cognitive impairment.


## What is Alzheimer's Disease?

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive type of dementia that impacts memory, thinking, and behavior.  In 2020, it was estimated that 5.8 million Americans were affected by Alzheimer's disease.  Although it is more common to develop Alzheimer's disease when you are beyond 65 years old, it can affect younger people.  In recent years, there has been a small upward trend of Alzheimer's disease developing at a younger age.  This means that Alzheimer's disease is impacting families sooner than before.  That is why if Alzheimer's disease is suspected, it is a good idea to get an [Alzheimer's Care plan](/services) together.  

## What are the 7 stages of Alzheimer's disease? 

Alzheimer's disease begins to affect the brain well before a person becomes symptomatic.  There are typically 7 stages that your loved one may experience but each person's experience is different and the stages and symptoms will vary depending on your loved one's personal circumstances.  

- Stage 1: Normal Outward Behavior
    - At this stage there are no noticeable symptoms that you can observe.  At this stage, scientists are developing technology that assist PET scans to better detect Alzheimer's disease.  
- Stage 2: Very Mild Changes
    - At this stage, you may still not detect any changes in your loved one's behavior, but they may be able to detect small personal changes such as forgetting words and misplacing items.  These symptoms are usually subtle and do not interfere with your loved one's ability to function independently.  Sometimes, these small changes may not be Alzheimer's disease at all but normal changes associated with aging.  
- Stage 3: Mild Decline
    - This is the point where you will most often start to notice symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.  Often times your loved one will start to forget things that they read, ask the same question repeatedly, have difficulty making plans, or forget names when meeting people.  At this point, you can assist your loved one by helping them remember certain activities such as going to appointments and paying their bills.  This is often a good phase to ensure your loved one has their legal and financial affairs in order.  
- Stage 4: Moderate Decline
    - Problems from stage 3 are usually accentuated and new problems arise.  You may notice your loved one forgetting details about themselves, having trouble with dates, months, and seasons, or have difficulty with common tasks such as cooking or reading simple written directions.  At this point it is a good idea to assist with chores and [make a safety plan](/services).  This is also a good time to put in place a plan against [elder abuse](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/elder-abuse).
- Stage 5: Moderately Severe Decline
    - Your loved one might lose track of where they are and what time it is at this stage.  Addresses, phone numbers, and personal histories may become difficult to recall.  At this stage, your loved one may become confused about how to dress appropriately.  This is a good time to put good routine practices in place such as laying out their clothing for them in the morning.  This will help your loved one keep their sense of independence.  Although your loved one may not be able to remember as many facts and details at this stage, they are often able to vividly recall stories and memorable times.  
- Stage 6: Severe Decline
    - At this stage, your loved one may continue to recognize faces but not be able to recall names.  Your loved one may also mistake a person for someone else at this stage.  During this period your loved one may have delusions such as thinking they need to go to work even though they no longer have a job.  Your loved one may need more help at this stage such as using the bathroom.  Music, old photos, and being read to are great activities to engage your loved on at this stage.  
- Stage 7: Very Severe Decline
    - Many of the basic abilities such as eating and walking are difficult to maintain during this period.  Staying involved is critical at this stage and you can help your loved one by helping them eat soft, easy-to-swallow foods and ensure they are taking enough water.  Many people at this stage are unable to tell when they are thirsty.
