## How to Choose Assisted living

When your loved one needs help with daily tasks but doesn't need intensive medical care, assisted living may be a good option.  It is a way to them live independently but in a safe and caring environment.  Sometimes, assisted living can be a parge of a larger nursing care center, hospital, or senior community.  Arbor house Assisted Living Home is a small assisted living facility that can accomodate up to 8 adults.  We specialize in Alzheimer's and dementia care.

## What is Assisted Living Like
Residents have their own private rooms and there is a common room for socialization and activities.  This is beneficial because residents can have privacy when they want but are encouraged to participate in the community and gain a sense of choice and independence.  

## Benefits of Living In An Assisted Living Home

There are many benefits that come with living in an assisted living home.
- Socialization  
    - It gives residents a chance to socialize which will make them less likely to feel isolated and lonely.  
- Nutrition  
    - Residents nutritional needs are assessed and met on a daily basis.  
    - Often times, as our loved ones age, getting proper nutrition becomes difficult.  
- Stimulation  
    - Participating in activities will help them feel physically and mentally stimulated.
- Less Stress
    - Knowing that your loved one is in a safe, nurturing environment, and that their needs are taken care of, will lead to less stress for their family members.
