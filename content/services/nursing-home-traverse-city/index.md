## What Is A Nursing home

Nursing homes are skilled nursing facilities that provide a wide range of health and personal care services.  They are typically 24-hour staffed facilities that provide consistent meals and assistance with every day activities.  They can also provide rehabilitation services, such as occupational, and speech therapy.  

Some people will stay at a nursing home for a short period.  However, most nursing home residents live there permanently because they have ongoing physical or mental conditions that require constant care and supervision.  

## Choosing A Nursing Home

It is important to consider what you want.  Does your family member need nursing care, meals, physical therapy, religious needs, or hospice care?  Geographical location is also important to consider so your family member can be close to their loved ones and get visitors on occasion.  

It can be good to talk to friends, relatives, social workers, and other medical professionals to get some recommendations of where to find a good nursing home.  Professionals will give good opinions about the quality of care certain nursing homes offer.  When you have a list you can then get in touch with each place to find how more information.  Many nursing homes will provide the waiting list time, as well as an average cost for residents.  

If you think a nursing home might be a good fit, you can usually schedule a tour to see the facility.  It is also a good idea to consider if the facility accepts Medicare and Medicaid, has handicap access, residents look to be well cared for, and the staff seems warm and inviting.  

Don't be afraid to ask questions when visiting the home.  Ask the staff to explain any bad odors or damage that may be present.  Also, it can be helpful to find out how long certain staff members have been working at the nursing home.  If things check out, it can be good to make a second, unannounced visit to the home to ensure that the nursing home is still neat and attractive and that everything looks inviting.

If you decide on a nursing home make sure to read your contract carefully before signing.  Always ask questions about things that you do not understand and get clarification.  IF you still do not understand, it is recommended that you ask a friend, or better, bring someone along who is more savvy.
