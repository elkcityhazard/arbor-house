## Types Of dementia

Although Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, there are many kinds of dementia that can affect a person.  If your loved one was recently diagnosed with a form of dementia it is a good idea to get [an care plan in place](/arbor-house/services).  Arbor House Assisted Living specializes in caring for those affected by dementia. 


### Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease

Prion proteins are found throughout the body.  For reasons not understood yet, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is caused when these prion proteins gradually start folding into a three-dimensional shape.  This type of dementia often gets worse at an unusually fast pace.  

Throughout the process, brain cells are destroyed.  The resulting damage leads to a quick decline in thinking and reasoning and can also affect muscle movements, confusion, mood changes, and difficult walking.  This disease is very rare and it is estimated to affect 1 million people anually worldwide.

### Lewy Body Dementia

Lewy body dementia is a progressive dementia caused by abnormal microscopic deposits that damage the brain over time.  It is estimated that Lewy body dementia is the third most common type of dementia which accounts for up to 10% of all cases.  Lew bodies are also found in other brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia. [We can help you plan for Lewy body dementia care](/arbor-house/contact).

### Down Syndrome and Alzheimer's Disease

As a person with Down Syndrome ages, they develop an increased risk of developing dementia that can be similar to Alzheimer's disease.  According to the National Down Syndrome Society, about 30% of people with Down syndrome who are in their 50's have Alzheimer's Disease.  For those in their 60's, about 50% develop Amzheimer's dementia.  Diagnosing adults with Down syndrome is difficult because they often will not report concerns regarding their memory.

### Frontotemporal dementia

Frontotemporal degenerations refers to a collection of disorders caused by progressive nerve cell loss in the front of the brain.  This specifically affects the area behind your forehead which is known as the frontal lobes as well as the area behind your ears which is also known as the temporal lobes.  Diagnosis is usually in a person's early 40's up to their 60's.  Behavioral changes are most often the first noticeable symptom of Frontotemporal dementia.  Also, those affected typically have greater difficult with speech than those diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease initially.

### Huntington's Disease


Huntington's disease is a progressive brain disorder caused by a defective gene.  It affects the central area of the brain which causes deterioration in movement, mood, and thinking skills.  Symptoms usually develop between the ages of 30 and 50.  The most common symptom and defining characteristic of Huntington's disease is the uncontrolled movement of the arms, legs, head, face, and upper body.  As it progresses, Huntington's disease will also cause a deficiency in thinking and reasoning skills.  Concentration, judgement, and organization skills will be affected and make day to day planning more difficult.  Depression, anxiety, and uncharacteristic anger and irritability can also develop.  Additionally, some people with Huntington's disease can develop obsessive-compulsive disorders.

### Parkinson's Disease Dementia

Parkinson's disease dementia is a decline in thinking and reasoning that develops in many people after diagnosis.  An estimated 50% to 80% of those affected by Parkinson's disease will develop dementia as the disease progresses.  Studies suggest that the average onset time for Parkinson's disease dementia is nearly 10 years from diagnosis.  Changes in memory, trouble interpreting visual information, muffled speech, hallucinations, and delusions are some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease dementia.
