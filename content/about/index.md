The peaceful setting allows the residents to regain their sense of independence by enjoying the lush grounds and walkways which are fenced and secured.

Arbor House Assisted Living Home boasts large rooms for the residents to gather, socialize, watch TV , read, etc. . The family-like atmosphere stimulates participation through daily activities for example folding towels, setting the table, arranging flowers from the garden or making Peach cake. Several nooks, a sun room with fireplace, front porch and back deck provide private areas for reading or a nap.
