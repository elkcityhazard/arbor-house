## Important Update

April 1, 2022

Dear Arbor House Families & Friends:

It is with mixed emotions and a heavy heart that I am informing you of the closure of Arbor House assisted living at the end of the month - April 2022.  My husband has continued to need more and more care.  As a result of his Lewy Body Dementia Diagnosis, I feel like this summer might be his last opportunity to have any normal activities and still be aware of his family and surroundings.

It is for this reason among others that I must give you 30 day notice to relocate your loved ones.  I will help in any and all ways that I can with this necessarytransition.  I have been told by Grand Traverse Pavilion admission coordinator that most likely our AH residents will be accepted but we need to move forward withtheir admission requirements.  I was very grateful to get that info.  
	

Of course it's up to you where your folks go but at least this is a viable option.
Please don't hesitate to contact me through out this moving process.  God Bless you all and thanks for your care and concern.   The AH team knows it has been a trueprivilege to support our beloved residents and thank you for that opportunity.
